                    <p> Kirby is a pink puffball and the main character of the respective series. He is 
                        one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons. His round appearance, simple design
                        and ability to copy his foes' powers have made him a well-known figure in videogames, which
                        makes him one of the most iconic videogame characters.
                    </p>
                    <p> He has a wide variety of copy abilities, ranging from simple abilities like
                        Fire and Sword to quite complex powers like UFO. In some of the games, he also
                        has access to unique Super Abilities, which include Ultra Abilities and Hypernova.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, he is the epitomy of kindness as he has zero intent of malice and evil, 
                        all his intentions are towards the greater good, even his opposite self(AKA Shadow Kirby) is as pure as he is.
                        He may also have the privilege of being the mightiest character in videogames, and even fiction! He also has 
                        different comics and even an anime after him.
